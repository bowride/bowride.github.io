#### Bowride is a website that will allow users to organize carpools with other members of the UH community. Users can sign up to be a driver or rider, and drivers can search for riders that are most convenient to/from campus. These carpools can be reoccurring such as everyday classes or one-time such as for special events. A rating system for both drivers and passengers prevents abuses, plus a special administrator mode that enables the site admin to remove users based upon substantiated complaints.
